  **1. what can it tell you about stupid -**
  so what can i tell you about the cutest smartest most beautiful girl i ever met. her smile is and will be the most magical thing in the whole wide world cause no matter how sad i am, that smile lights up my whole fucking world and i will literally do anything and everything in my power to not let that smile get away from her face. anybody whos reading this or even stupid if you are reading this which i hope not cause this will probably come very creppy to you, so yeah anybody whos reading this will tell me that just get over her but thing is i love her and it wouldnt be love if i could just take the whole worlds advice and give up on her and walk away and which is also probably the healthy thing too but again it is love so giving up not really an option now is it, sometimes i hope i was barney cause he stays happy and well isnt that the goal but what can i do if god made me a ted. so yeah about stupid, most people will think shes just a pretty girl and thats it but it just astonishes me what shes gone through, shes also one of the strongest person and also why i respect her so damn much but if you ask her she will probabbly tell you the opposite cause making fun of her is sometimes the only thing to talk that will never finish for me and also make her smile and happy. did i tell you shes also the mosst amazing baker i met cause if i can literally eat her brownies every fucking day. idk what kind of joke god was playing on him that he made us meet each other and made me fall in love with her but for just kept me a friends and kept increasing the distance between us, and if this isnt enough every time i didnt call her for days thinking i was just a bother in her life, he made her call me and just started all over again. but sometimes idk weather to thank god that we met or curse him for pushing us away, and last thing is ki i dont even know this what i am in her eyes a friend, a best friend or just a guy she replies to cuse shes just so polite. for every reason i should hope to god that stupid you don read this but the last question is the only that i want answer to so badly that i wish that u stuble across this page and read this.

 but i guess somewhere in the multi fucking verse we are together
