Hi, As you already know I'm Shivansh Gupta. not much to tell, so i was born and raised in india. i do alright in academics but not much interested in the rat race of the world. i wanna be different even if not remebered, i wanna be happy and live my life to fullest not stopped by the shackles of money(but now what i mean is i gotta have a lot of it), i have a lott of hobies like sports and art but not gonna bore u with all of them. so basically had a lot of thoughts and thought those thoughts were really good so thats how i started my blog, and i also building this website/blog was also another project of mine :D Sooo Enjoy
