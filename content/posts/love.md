To be honest i really dont know what i feel about love but what i do know it is the most powerful feeling a person can feel, period. Love for me on one hand made me feel joy i thought i never could feel but on the same time it made cry like over things i never thought i could, but i guess that's one of the highs and lows of life. I always thought love was supposed to hurt, maybe i still do but a line that gives me comfort from a bollywood movie if you have ever seen "Rab na bana di jodi" was that no, love is a beautiful thing and it is a blessing not a curse, you don't love someone because you expect love back but because simply you just love them, there's no reason for it and there doesnt have to be, and if you are struggling with the last sentence, i understand cause i do too because it really doesnt make any sense right, feeling such a powerful thing for a person without any reason, it's as stupid as it can be but it is what it is. For everyone out there who don't let themself experience this, i can say but one thing for u which i myself tries to follow, its that that yes rejection hurts but you know what hurts more is regret, regret of not trying, regret of not confessing your love when u could have, regretting not trying harder. Now for those of you who don't know me, I'm an introverted guy and therefore every time i planned to meet her, i had butterlies(yes guys get that too), got anxious, nervous and everyother stupid feeling but i still did, cause the one reason that i didn't want for her and me not to be we was for the lack of my trying. I think Love is stuck between two paths- "if it's meant to be, it will be" and "If you want something, you have to go get it " and as much as i would like to know the correct path, I don't and maybe there is a correct way, or maybe not :). 

You know it's really easy to stop feeling, well atleast it is for me, it's much easier to not fall in love then to do, it's much easier to not take a chance than to do that's why you are not strong if you are cold to other even if it may seem superficially. It's a lot damn harder to get your heartbroken then to not even try, even this may all be true sometimes it just hurts a lot but then i just imagine the kind of life of me being cold and ig i dont wanna have the regret of that maybe i would have let myself be a little happier, cause you can't be happy without being sad, you can't be laugh freely if you cant cry freely. 

First love or falling in love at young age is much much harder, but ig everyone have suffered that but it just comess easier to some than others. For me it's much to difficult than others i think, i was convinced the first girl i loved was the one, maybe still am and as much as i know that it's not the case i still so want it to be that somewhere in my euphoriated mind i'm convinced that it will be. To let go of the people you love
