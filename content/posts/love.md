To be honest i really dont know what i feel about love but what i do know it is the most powerful feeling a person can feel, period. Love for me on one hand made me feel joy i thought i never could feel but on the same time it made cry like over things i never thought i could, but i guess that's one of the highs and lows of life. I always thought love was supposed to hurt, maybe i still do but a line that gives me comfort from a bollywood movie if you have ever seen "Rab na bana di jodi" was that no, love is a beautiful thing and it is a blessing not a curse, you don't love someone because you expect love back but because simply you just love them, there's no reason for it and there doesnt have to be, and if you are struggling with the last sentence, i understand cause i do too because it really doesnt make any sense right, feeling such a powerful thing for a person without any reason, it's as stupid as it can be but it is what it is. For everyone out there who don't let themself experience this, i can say but one thing for u which i myself tries to follow, its that that yes rejection hurts but you know what hurts more is regret, regret of not trying, regret of not confessing your love when u could have, regretting not trying harder. Now for those of you who don't know me, I'm an introverted guy and therefore every time i planned to meet her, i had butterlies(yes guys get that too), got anxious, nervous and everyother stupid feeling but i still did, cause the one reason that i didn't want for her and me not to be we was for the lack of my trying. I think Love is stuck between two paths- "if it's meant to be, it will be" and "If you want something, you have to go get it " and as much as i would like to know the correct path, I don't and maybe there is a correct way, or maybe not :). 

Love can easily be the reason someone wanna live but can easily kill em to, so ig be safe out there.
