  **1. Happiness or Success -**
  &#8203;
  My main confusion with life is that is the goal to be happy or successful cause there always comes a time when a person has to choose.  As you already know from my home page, happiness takes a smalll edge in my mind over success and believe you me the situation was quite different a while ago. i thought that there will always come a time when i will get my heartbreak or cry or just be sad so i'd rather cry in my porsche than a maruti, but then what i realised is that maybe its just not that diffcult to be be happy(also not easy) that maybe, just maybe success doesnt have to be equated with happiness.

**2. Lonely or Alone -**

  I've been alone a lot but never really lonely and didnt understand the difference between them untill recently.
